# Web-Structure-Analysis-of-The-Hindu-News-Portal

In the project "Web Structure Analysis of The Hindu News Portal," I employed web crawling and network analysis techniques to dissect the web structure of The Hindu, a prominent news portal. Using the Screaming Frog crawler, I collected URLs and then visualized the web graph with Gephi, focusing on the largest connected component.

I applied various metrics, including in-degree, out-degree, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, PageRank, and modularity, to gain insights into the web structure. The modularity analysis revealed patterns aligning with the website's sections.

Additionally, I identified and ranked the top nodes, excluding sitewide links, to uncover influential elements within the network. This project offers a unique perspective on The Hindu's web dynamics.
